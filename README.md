## Info
An accordion is used to show (and hide) HTML content. In the case of this plugin, this can be one or more collapsable elements.

They are sometimes also known as a [disclosure widget or a twistie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details).

* Figure out a way to show in Panel preview whether editor has toggled to show open attribute on page load
