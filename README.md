# kirby-accordion-block

This is a [custom block plugin](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks) for the [Kirby CMS](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby). It is used to add a custom accordion block that uses semantic HTML. Shipping without any CSS requirements, it is unopinionated but easy to style if you are so inclined.

## Example
<details open>
	<summary>System Requirements</summary>
	<p>Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer
  must have some memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage.
  An input device as well as some form of output device is
  recommended.</p>
</details>

## Info
An accordion is used to show (and hide) HTML content.

They are sometimes also known as a [disclosure widget or a twistie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details).

## Problems / ToDos
* Figure out a way to hide eg. `<p>` tags from writer field for Panel preview
* Figure out a way to show in Panel preview whether editor has toggled to show open attribute on page load
* Add screenshot to repository
* Check it is accessible
